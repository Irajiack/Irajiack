<h2> Hello! </h2> 
I'm Irajiack (She/Her), but you can call me Ira for short! I'm your local French Canadian ADHD potato! 

I'm a full-stack dev, I mostly gear toward self projects and freelancing! I've been coding for more than 13 years! Starting easy with HTML, CSS and PHP in 2008 and by 2010 I started learning Javascript and Ajax! I am not concidering myself has specially gift or extremely good at it but I do think I can defend myself!

In 2010 i got my dragon breeding game out! I still have the horrible old code that I cannot read anymore eheh.
Sadly, my old game is discontinued since 2016, but I learned a whole lot with it! Lasted a good ol' 6 years of time! Why did I discountinued it? Because a teen with very little money cannot pay outta pocket for the server storage and BDD needed at the time! 

I'm also an artist and a writer! Well more an artist than a writer minds you but I can do some stuff! I also started to dip my toes in 3D making! 

I also happen to be an Inkblot volunteer for the Community Event team! :D
