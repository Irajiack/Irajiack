<h2> It is a-me, Irajiack! </h2> 
I'm Irajiack, but you can call me Ira for short! 
I'm your local French Canadian ADHD potato! 

I'm a full-stack dev, I mostly gear toward self projects and freelancing! I've been coding for more than 13 years! Starting easy with HTML, CSS and PHP in 2008 and by 2010 I started learning Javascript and Ajax! I am not concidering myself as "gifted" or extremely good at it but I definetely can defend myself! 

However, if you need a remote devs that is more accostumed to vanilla without framework code work you can shoot me a message! 

I have several on going projects and a few that are finished! A few of those the repository are public, but some of them are private for security reason! If you are an employer and need to access those repositories, please just ask about it! I don't bite, I swear. Before anyone ask, no, I did not use any Generative AI (Aka LLMs) for any of my codes, it's all written by hands minus a few stuff glarned from the internet. I mostly prefer doing everything from scratch! 

I'm also an artist and a writer! Well more an artist than a writer minds you but I can do some stuff! I also started to dip my toes in 3D making!

in 2010 i had a web browser Dragon Breeding game called Dragoniss! It is not available anymore as I was a teenager back then and paying for a server was problematic and pricey and it closed in 2016. 
I am remaking, kind of, the same game renamed as <a href="https://arcanadraconis.ca/">Arcana Draconis</a>! A lot of the system are going to be entierly new, while some others will remain from the older game. Even thou I still have the files for the 2010 game, I can't use them as they are older version of PHP amongst other things, on top of being clearly unreadable for anyone having a brain, including me <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1049110600145448980.webp?size=96&quality=lossless">

I am also, at the moment, hired as a volunteer (Community Event Team!) for <a href="https://inkblot.art" target="_blank">Inkblot</a>! 
Inkblot is a non-profit artist community that is brand new and the website still being in beta-testing phase! Hopefully, maybe one day I'll be able to code for them as well. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1112828851417002024.webp?size=40&quality=lossless">
